# 🧠 Multimodal Parkinson’s Disease Detection System

A machine learning–based **multimodal screening application** that analyzes **handwriting patterns, MRI brain scans, and voice recordings** to estimate the likelihood of Parkinson’s disease. The system combines classical machine learning and deep learning techniques to provide a **probabilistic, non-invasive risk assessment** intended for clinical decision support.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Parkinson’s disease affects motor control, neurological structure, and speech characteristics. Relying on a single diagnostic signal can be unreliable. This project addresses that limitation by integrating **three complementary data modalities**:

* ✍️ **Handwriting** (spiral & wave drawings)
* 🧠 **MRI brain scans**
* 🎙️ **Voice recordings**

Each modality is analyzed independently using domain-appropriate models, and their outputs are combined to generate a final risk score.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This system is **not a diagnostic tool**. It is designed to assist clinicians and researchers by providing early risk indicators.

## 🧩 System Architecture

### 1. Handwriting Analysis

* Input: Spiral and wave drawings
* Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, resizing, Otsu thresholding
* Feature Extraction: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
* Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Output: Probability of Parkinson’s disease

### 2. MRI Scan Analysis

* Input: Preprocessed MRI brain scans
* Feature extraction / learning via ML/DL models
* Output: Parkinson’s probability score

### 3. Voice Analysis

* Input: Short voice recordings
* Feature extraction using audio signal processing
* Model: Machine learning classifier
* Output: Parkinson’s probability score

### 4. Decision Fusion

* Combines predictions from handwriting, MRI, and voice
* Final output: **Aggregated probabilistic risk score**
